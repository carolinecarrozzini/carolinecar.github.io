# Caroline Carrozzini's Webpage

This is a page where I'll share some information about myself and the work that I amd doing in biostatistics/bioinformatics. So far, I've done some work to analyze data on Penguins and, most recently, NYC squirrels.

## NYC Squirrel Analysis 
February 2023: In this analysis, I worked on developing hypotheses and finding proper code to find information of the questions I was asking. If you are interested, you can find my work [here](https://carolinecarrozzini.github.io/NYC-squirrels.html)

## Penguins
January 2023: In this document, you will find my work from when I was first discovering how to work with Rstudio. You can find that [here](https://carolinecarrozzini.github.io/BioStatisticsAnalysis/PalmerPenguinsAnalysis.html)
